The physics of air-showers is summarized and we also present the results obtained on the proton–air cross section and on the muon content of the showers. We discuss the cosmic ray propagation through magnetic fields, the effects of diffusion and of magnetic lensing, the cosmic ray interactions with background radiation fields and the production of secondary neutrinos and photons. We also consider the cosmic ray anisotropies, both at large and small angular scales, presenting the results obtained from the TeV up to the highest energies and discuss the models proposed to explain their origin.}

Technological advances in recent decades have extended our vision by allowing the detection of photons across a wide spectrum, from radio waves to gamma-rays. Above O(∼1TeV), however, electromagnetic radiation may not penetrate the gases and dust between their sources and us. Two windows into the highest-energy phenomenon in the Universe are cosmic rays and neutrinos. So far, fluxes of charged particles above EeV and neutrinos above TeV have been measured. Here, we review the role of Cherenkov light in the detection of these two cosmic messengers by focusing on the Pierre Auger Observatory and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, and illustrate the continued importance of light in revealing the Universe.}

In this paper I review the present status of the search for muon decays beyond the Standard Model, with a special attention to the most conventional muon lepton flavor violation experiments, but also considering more exotic scenarios and future outlooks.}

The special high altitude and wide-field environment requires simple and stable calibration as well as monitoring method of MDs. In this paper, the muon decay events will be selected for calibrating the charge and monitoring the water level of each MD. In the prototype muon detector, the simulation and experiment results reveal that the charge of the decay electron is approximately 0.147 times that of the vertical equivalent muon for a standard MD, and the QVEM∕Qe shows a linear correlation with the water level.}

The LAGO WCD is simple and robust, and incorporates several integrated devices to allow time synchronization, autonomous operation, on board data analysis, as well as remote control and automated data transfer. This detection network is designed to make detailed measurements of the temporal evolution of the radiation flux coming from outer space at ground level. LAGO is mainly oriented to perform basic research in three areas: high energy phenomena, space weather and atmospheric radiation at ground level. It is an observatory designed, built and operated by the LAGO Collaboration, a non-centralized collaborative union of more than 30 institutions from ten countries. In this paper we describe the scientific and academic goals of the LAGO project - illustrating its present status with some recent results - and outline its future perspectives.}

Relative to the 3FGL catalog, the 4FGL catalog has twice as much exposure as well as a number of analysis improvements, including an updated model for the Galactic diffuse γ-ray emission, and two sets of light curves (one-year and two-month intervals). The 4FGL catalog includes 5064 sources above 4σ significance, for which we provide localization and spectral properties. Seventy-five sources are modeled explicitly as spatially extended, and overall, 358 sources are considered as identified based on angular extent, periodicity, or correlated variability observed at other wavelengths. For 1336 sources, we have not found plausible counterparts at other wavelengths. More than 3130 of the identified or associated sources are active galaxies of the blazar class, and 239 are pulsars.}

Three classes of telescope types spread over a large area are required to cover the full CTA very-high energy range from 20 GeV to 300 TeV. Building on the technology of current generation ground-based gamma-ray detectors (H.E.S.S., VERITAS and MAGIC), CTA will be 5 to 20 times more sensitive, depending on gamma-ray energy, and have unprecedented accuracy in its detection of high-energy gamma rays. Current gamma-ray telescope arrays host up to five individual telescopes, but CTA is designed to detect gamma rays over a larger area and a wider field of view.Prototypes for the major CTA subsystems including the various size telescopes and cameras have been developed and built at different places. CTA is currently preparing for the full construction phase, both technically and organizationally, with the goal to achieve first light by the year 2022 and completion by 2024/25.CTA will be the first ground-based gamma-ray observatory open to the worldwide astronomical and particle physics communities as a resource for data from unique, high-energy astronomical observations.}

abstract = {The origin and nature of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays remains a mystery. However, great progress has
been made in recent years due to the observations performed by the Pierre Auger Observatory and
Telescope Array. In particular, it is believed that the composition information of the cosmic rays as a
function of the energy can play a fundamental role for the understanding of their origin. The best indicators
for primary mass composition are the muon content of extensive air shower and the atmospheric depth of
the shower maximum. In this work we consider a maximum likelihood method to perform mass
composition analyses based on the number of muons measured by underground muon detectors. The
analyses are based on numerical simulations of the showers. The effects introduced by the detectors and the
methods used to reconstruct the experimental data are also taken into account through a dedicated
simulation that uses as input the information of the simulated showers. In order to illustrate the use of the
method, we consider AMIGA (Auger Muons and Infill for the Ground Array), the low energy extension of
the Pierre Auger Observatory that directly measures the muonic content of extensive air showers. We also
study in detail the impact of the use of different high energy hadronic interaction models in the composition
analyses performed. It is found that differences of a few percent between the predicted number of muons
have a significant impact on composition determination.}

	abstract = {The Crab Nebula is the brightest TeV gamma-ray source in the sky and has been used for the past 25 years as a reference source in TeV astronomy, for calibration and verification of new TeV instruments. The High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC), completed in early 2015, has been used to observe the Crab Nebula at high significance across nearly the full spectrum of energies to which HAWC is sensitive. HAWC is unique for its wide field of view, nearly 2 sr at any instant, and its high-energy reach, up to 100 TeV. HAWC’s sensitivity improves with the gamma-ray energy. Above ∼1 TeV the sensitivity is driven by the best background rejection and angular resolution ever achieved for a wide-field ground array. We present a time-integrated analysis of the Crab using 507 live days of HAWC data from 2014 November to 2016 June. The spectrum of the Crab is fit to a function of the form . The data is well fitted with values of α = 2.63 ± 0.03, β = 0.15 ± 0.03, and when E0 is fixed at 7 TeV and the fit applies between 1 and 37 TeV. Study of the systematic errors in this HAWC measurement is discussed and estimated to be ±50\% in the photon flux between 1 and 37 TeV. Confirmation of the Crab flux serves to establish the HAWC instrument’s sensitivity for surveys of the sky. The HAWC all-sky survey will be the deepest survey of the northern sky ever conducted in the multi-TeV band.}
